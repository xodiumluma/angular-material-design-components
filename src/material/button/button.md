Angular Material buttons are native `<button>` or `<a>` elements enhanced with Material Design
styling and ink ripples.

<!-- example(button-overview) -->

Native `<button>` and `<a>` elements are always used in order to provide the most straightforward
and accessible experience for users. A `<button>` element should be used whenever some _action_
is performed. An `<a>` element should be used whenever the user will _navigate_ to another view.


There are several button variants, each applied as an attribute:

| Attribute            | Description                                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mat-button`         | Rectangular text button w/ no elevation                                  |
| `mat-raised-button`  | Rectangular contained button w/ elevation                                |
| `mat-flat-button`    | Rectangular contained button w/ no elevation                             |
| `mat-stroked-button` | Rectangular outlined button w/ no elevation                              |
| `mat-icon-button`    | Circular button with a transparent background, meant to contain an icon  |
| `mat-fab`            | Circular button w/ elevation, defaults to theme's accent color           |
| `mat-mini-fab`       | Same as `mat-fab` but smaller                                            |


### Theming
Buttons can be colored in terms of the current theme using the `color` property to set the
background color to `primary`, `accent`, or `warn`.

### Capitalization
According to the Material design spec button text has to be capitalized, however we have opted not
to capitalize buttons automatically via `text-transform: uppercase`, because it can cause issues in
certain locales. It is also worth noting that using ALL CAPS in the text itself causes issues for
screen-readers, which will read the text character-by-character. We leave the decision of how to
approach this to the consuming app.

### Extended fab buttons
Traditional fab buttons are circular and only have space for a single icon. However, you can add the
`extended` attribute to allow the fab to expand into a rounded rectangle shape with space for a text
label in addition to the icon. Only full sized fabs support the `extended` attribute, mini fabs do
not.

```html
<button mat-fab extended>
  <mat-icon>home</mat-icon>
  Home
</button>
```

### Accessibility
Angular Material uses native `<button>` and `<a>` elements to ensure an accessible experience by
default. A `<button>` element should be used for any interaction that _performs an action on the
current page_. An `<a>` element should be used for any interaction that _navigates to another
URL_. All standard accessibility best practices for buttons and anchors apply to `MatButton`.

#### Disabling anchors
`MatAnchor` supports disabling an anchor in addition to the features provided by the native
`<a>` element. When you disable an anchor, the component sets `aria-disabled="true"` and
`tabindex="-1"`. Always test disabled anchors in your application to ensure compatibility
with any assistive technology your application supports.

#### Buttons with icons
Buttons or links containing only icons (such as `mat-fab`, `mat-mini-fab`, and `mat-icon-button`)
should be given a meaningful label via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`. [See the documentation
for `MatIcon`](https://material.angular.io/components/icon) for more
information on using icons in buttons.

#### Toggle buttons
[See the documentation for `MatButtonToggle`](https://material.angular.io/components/button-toggle)
for information on stateful toggle buttons.
